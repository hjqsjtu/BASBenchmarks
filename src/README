1. All Parameters used by benchmark: BASParameters.m
2. Models of the individual BAS Components labelled as XXXModel.m where "XXX" corresponds to the respective component
3. File to initiate and simulate the whole BAS set-up being considered (cf. Fig 1 in paper): WholeBAS_setup.m
4. Core file: createModel.m: Used by all model files. It is a class file which,
  (i) initialises the models based on their underlying structure and input system matrices;
  (ii) converts the models into symbolic models
  (iii) allows to simulate the models
  (iv) provides option to perform a step response of the underlying model (for analysis)
5. Auxiliary file: PlotFigures.m: plots simulation output over specified time horizon
