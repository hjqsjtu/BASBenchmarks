# BASBenchmarks

This is a repository for the benchmarks presented within the publication:

Benchmarks for cyber-physical systems: A modular model library for buildings automation. Nathalie Cauchi, Alessandro Abate.
Submitted to International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems, 2018. Under Review

This repository hosts the instances and descriptions of the benchmarks. It includes all the three presented case-studies. In each case we include a brief description of the underlying dynamics, together with details on the associated parameters.

Please read the commented lines in the model development file.
Please do not forget to cite the publication! Thank you!
